1. Description.

Program in C language implementing the "shunting yard" algorithm by Edsger Dijkstra.
The input is a string that is a mathematical expression, then the string is converted 
into an output string written using the Dijkstra algorithm in Reverse Polish Notation. 
The expression is then evaluated in the [0..4Pi] area and the value area [-1..+1] and a graph of the function is plotted.
The axis of the ordinate is directed downwards, the axis of the abscissa lies in the middle of the field.
The program is educational and can handle just part of the functions of the math.h library.

2. Installation.

On Linux compile the software using "make". On Windows use "make" from Cygwin (http://cygwin.com).
